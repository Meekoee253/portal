			<p>
				My name is Mico Enriquez, and I am an aspiring software developer.
				Currently I am enrolled in a condensed 6-month program called Year-Up,
				which provides college credited courses and an internship in the tech
				field. Throughout the program, I am learning and practicing different
				coding languages aswell as practicing some business practices like
				project managing. Some of the projects I am apart of through GitHub are
				on my link here. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns you
				can reach me at my LinkedIn.
			</p>
 
			<p>
				Prior to the Year-Up program I graduated with an Associates of the Arts
				degree through Pierce College and worked as a pharmacy technician. I
				have been wanting to get into tech since I was younger but didnâ€™t have
				the courage or resources to do so. With my newfound courage and the
				availability of resources I have, I am ready to dive into the tech
				industry and what it has to offer. Aside from programming and being a
				student, I spend most of my time traveling, hiking, and experiencing the
				different culinary foods has to offer. As I mentioned earlier, my
				LinkedIn and other contact information are listed above if you want any
				recommendations on places to visit or food to try!
